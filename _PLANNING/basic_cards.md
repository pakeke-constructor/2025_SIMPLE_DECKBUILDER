## Ability cards:

(3-5) of spades: Deal X damage to an enemy
(2-3) of clubs: Remove -X attack from an enemy
(3-5) of hearts: Give an ally +X health
(2-3) of diamonds: Give an ally +X attack
(3-5) of shields: Give an ally +X block

Ace of spades: Deal 2 damage to all enemies
Ace of hearts: Give all allies +1 health
Ace of diamonds: Give all allies +1 attack
Ace of shields: Give all allies +2 block

**(TODO: Maybe we can be more creative than this?)**
Jack cards: Synergize with block, somehow
    (eg: Jack of hearts: Give ally health equal to it's block)
Queen cards: Synergize with health, somehow
King cards: Synergize with attack, somehow


IMPORTANT NOTE:
The `Deal X damage` on spades cards should use the same `attack` value as unit-cards.
This means that if we have a card: "Give +X attack to all cards in hand",
It'll add attack to unit cards, AND ability-cards!!!
